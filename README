My first attempt at OpenCV. Tracks your body and detects if your arms are moving up or down. Written in C++ for a Mac, using the OpenCV framework package.

Code available here https://github.com/dscripps/Open-CV-Gesture-Demo

Inspired by Andrew Kirillov's tutorial here http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/hands_gesture_recognition.aspx?msg=...

A demo video of the program is available at http://youtu.be/boWjrXEuUDM
